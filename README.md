### About me :dizzy:
- I'm a python developer and bug bounty hunter for almost two years now. i enjoy creating open-source tools that helps people automating what they're doing. i did create some cool projects like easyShell that's using it's own scripting language to do a lot of stuff. it's 100% built-in python without using external libraries except colors libraries. i like hacking open-source projects more.
